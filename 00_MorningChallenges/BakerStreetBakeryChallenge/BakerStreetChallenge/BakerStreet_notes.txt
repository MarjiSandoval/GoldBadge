new console application called BakerStreetBakery. (skip)

The app will need classes to handle orders, products, and a repository of orders.

The client has specified that she organizes her products based on type - Bread, Cake, Pastry, Pies.

Each Product will have an associated price per batch that depends on the type.

The prices are $500.01 for bread
$2000 for cake
$200.10 for pasteries
and $851.5 for pies. 

Each Order will only have one associated product,
but also a number of batches, 
an order number, 
a total cost, =>The cost of each order is $100, plus the total cost of the batches in the order 
(base price per batch * number of batches)
and a customer name.



(Don't forget about your constructors)

 

Once you have created these classes, 
create a class for your repository called OrderRepository.

We need methods to add an order to the list,
get the list, 
remove from list,
and print the contents of the list.

 

Once your Repository is set up, 
create a Unit Test project called BakerStreetBakery_Tests. Test each of the four repo methods.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you get the Repository built and tested, next we will want to build out a ProgramUI.

Create a method named Run(). 

Go back to the Program class and create an instance of ProgramUI in the static void main method and call the Run method. 

 

Ex: ProgramUI program = new ProgramUI();

    program.Run();

 

Write a RunMenu method for Mrs. Hudson to use to handle orders. Use a numbered menu like we used for the StreamingContentRepository
